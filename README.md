    <h1>Good Books</h1>
    
    <p>There are many different books that are meant for elementary school kids. Here in this website, I will be telling you about my <strong>top three</strong> favorite books, and some other good books that I have read. I am also in elemantary school, so my recommendations <em>might</em> be something you can or would read.
    </p>
    <ul id="book-names">
        <li> Middle School
            
            
    </ul>
        
        
    <p> Middle School is a realistic fiction book series about a kid named Rafe Katchadorian and him going through middle school. This series is <strong>very</strong> similar to Diary of a Wimpy Kid, so if you like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, you should definitely check out Middle School. By the way, there are 15 books in the series. </p>

    <ul id="book-names">
        <li> Roald Dahl
            
            
    </ul>
        
        
    <p>Roald Dahl is a very famous author of many books. I am not going to recommend just one of his books, <strong>because they are all so good!</strong> My <em>personal</em> favorites are James and the Giant Peach and Matilda. They are both fiction books.</p>

    <ul id="book-names">
        <li> Diary of a Wimpy Kid
            
            
    </ul>
        
        
    <p> And last, we have DOAWK. That stands for Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I'm sure most of you have already read this book, so all I will say is it is just like middle school. It is about a kid named Greg Heffley and basically just his life story in middle school. This book series has 16 books, not including Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Adventure. That is a book by Greg's best friend, or Rowley Jefferson.</p>

    <p>Those were just my top three favorite books or book series'. Here are some <em>other</em> books that are good. I have read these too. </p>
    <ul id="list">
        <li> Big Nate
        <li> Crenshaw (lower elementary school level)
        <li> Dragonsdale (slighty lower elementary school level)
        <li> The Terrible Two
        <li> Charlottes Web
        <li> The Chronicles of Narnia
        <li> Weird but True (Plus the variations like Believe it or Not and 100 Most Awesome Things on the Planet)
        
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully taking the time to read my website has been productive for you and you have a book to read now. Most of these books I have recommended are in the higher grades of elementary school. If you can't read some, its fine. But for those who can, enjoy reading!</p>
